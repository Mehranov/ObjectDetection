# ObjectDetection

Here we write two separate codes. The first code (Building+your+Deep+Neural+Network+-+Step+by+Step+v8) is to design and develop the building block to create a neural net with an arbitrary architecture. Then we use this code in the second code (Deep+Neural+Network+-+Application+v8) to test our model. We test and compare our model for a two different systems here. First, a 2-layer neural network and then a 5-layer deep neural net with 20,50,4,1 hidden units respectively.
